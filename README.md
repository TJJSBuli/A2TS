Assignment 2 - Short Stack: Basic Two-tier Web Application using HTML/CSS/JS and Node.js  
===

Due: September 11th, by 11:59 AM.

This assignment aims to introduce you to creating a prototype two-tiered web application. 
Your application will include the use of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Node.js functionality, with active communication between the client and the server over the life of a user session.

Baseline Requirements
---

There is a large range of application areas and possibilities that meet these baseline requirements. 
Try to make your application do something useful! A todo list, storing / retrieving high scores for a very simple game... have a little fun with it.

Your application is required to implement the following functionalities:

- a `Server` which not only serves files, but also maintains a tabular dataset with 3 or more fields related to your application
- a `Results` functionality which shows the entire dataset residing in the server's memory
- a `Form/Entry` functionality which allows a user to add or delete data items residing in the server's memory
- a `Server Logic` which, upon receiving new or modified "incoming" data, includes and uses a function that adds at least one additional derived field to this incoming data before integrating it with the existing dataset
- the `Derived field` for a new row of data must be computed based on fields already existing in the row. 
For example, a `todo` dataset with `task`, `priority`, and `creation_date` may generate a new field `deadline` by looking at `creation_date` and `priority`

Your application is required to demonstrate the use of the following concepts:

HTML:
- One or more [HTML Forms](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Forms), with any combination of form tags appropriate for the user input portion of the application
- A results page displaying all data currently available on the server. You will most likely use a `<table>` tag for this, but `<ul>` or `<ol>` could also work and might be simpler to work with. Alternatively, you can create a single-page app (see Technical Acheivements) but this is not a requirement.
- All pages should [validate](https://validator.w3.org)
- If your app contains multple pages, they should all be accessible from the homepage (index.html)

CSS:
- CSS styling of the primary visual elements in the application
- Various CSS Selector functionality must be demonstrated:
    - Element selectors
    - ID selectors
    - Class selectors
- CSS positioning and styling of the primary visual elements in the application:
    - Use of either a CSS grid or flexbox for layout
    - Rules defining fonts for all text used; no default fonts! Be sure to use a web safe font or a font from a web service like [Google Fonts](http://fonts.google.com/)

- CSS defined in a maintainable, readable form, in external stylesheets 

JavaScript:
- At minimum, a small amount of front-end JavaScript to get / fetch data from the server; a sample is provided in this repository.

Node.js:
- An HTTP Server that delivers all necessary files and data for the application, and also creates the required `Derived Fields` in your data. 
A starting point is provided in this repository.

Deliverables
---

Do the following to complete this assignment and acheive a base grade of 85%:

1. Fork the starting project code (make sure to fork the 2023 repo!). This repo contains some starter code that may be used or discarded as needed.
2. Implement your project with the above requirements.
3. Test your project to make sure that when someone goes to your main page, it displays correctly.
4. Deploy your project to Glitch, and fill in the appropriate fields in your package.json file.
5. Ensure that your project has the proper naming scheme `a2-yourGithubUsername` so we can find it.
6. Modify the README to the specifications below, and delete all of the instructions originally found in this README.
7. Create and submit a Pull Request to the original repo. Label the pull request as follows: a2-gitusername-firstname-lastname
